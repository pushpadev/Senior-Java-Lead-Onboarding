## Pre-Onboarding Knowledge: Key Concepts to Understand

### Key Meetings & Interactions
1. **1:1 Meeting**: Regular scheduled meetings between you and your manager or team members to discuss performance, challenges, goals, and provide feedback in a private setting
2. **Stand-up Meeting**: Brief daily team meetings (typically 15 minutes) where each member shares what they did yesterday, what they plan to do today, and any blockers
3. **Sprint Planning**: Meeting to decide which items from the backlog will be worked on during the upcoming sprint
4. **Retrospective**: Team meeting at the end of a sprint to reflect on what went well, what didn't, and how to improve
5. **Grooming/Refinement**: Sessions where the team reviews and clarifies upcoming backlog items

### Project Management Terminology
1. **Project Roadmap**: Strategic document outlining the vision, direction, milestones, and timeline for product development
2. **Sprint**: Time-boxed period (usually 1-2 weeks) during which specific work must be completed
3. **Backlog**: Prioritized list of features, bug fixes, and technical work that the team needs to address
4. **User Story**: Description of a software feature from an end-user perspective
5. **Epic**: Large body of work that can be broken down into smaller user stories
6. **Acceptance Criteria**: Conditions that a product must satisfy to be accepted by stakeholders

### Technical Environments
1. **Local Development Environment**: Your personal development setup on your machine
2. **Development Environment (DEV)**: Shared environment for integrating code changes, lowest level of stability required
3. **Quality Assurance Environment (QA)**: Environment for testing functionality before moving to higher environments
4. **Staging/Pre-Production**: Mirror of production used for final testing, typically with production-like data
5. **Production (PROD)**: Live environment that end-users interact with
6. **Sandbox**: Isolated testing environment for experimenting without affecting other systems

### Version Control & Git Concepts
1. **Git Repository**: Storage location for your software package containing code, files, and revision history
2. **Branch**: Parallel version of the code for development or feature work
3. **Pull Request (PR)**: Request to merge changes from one branch into another, typically with code review
4. **Commit**: Snapshot of changes made to files in the repository
5. **Merge**: Combining changes from different branches
6. **Merge Conflict**: When Git can't automatically resolve differences between branches
7. **Git Flow**: Branching model with specific branch types for features, releases, and hotfixes
